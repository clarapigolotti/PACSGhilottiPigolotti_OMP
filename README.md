# APSC project: DE-PDE algorithm - fdaPDE library 

This repository contains the fdaPDE R library enriched with the Density Estimation - Partial Differential Equation (DE-PDE) algorithm. In this version the DE-PDE algorithm allows parallelization with OpenMP.

The source code is written in C++ and interfaced with R through .Call.

# Subfolder structure

/src contains all C++ code necessary to build and install the R package;
/R contains the R functions that wrap the C++ calls;
/data contains the data to run the tests.

# Package installation

Download the .zip of the code, unzip it, then from the R console type

install.packages('/path/to/PACSGhilottiPigolotti_OMP', type='source', repos=NULL)

To install the package, please make sure that you have the package devtools already installed. Moreover, it could be asked to install all the library dependencies (rgl, plot3D, plot3Drgl, RcppEigen, geometry).
For Windows, the latest version of Rtools is required.
